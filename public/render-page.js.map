—> <code>redis</code> 的缓存架构中，性能上是有所提升，但是还是无法避免缓存之间的数据交叉使用（如缓存A的数据从缓存B与缓存C的数据组合），在数据有误时需要清除缓存时痛点，交叉使用的数据已经无法理清该清理哪些缓存。</p>\\n<p>在系统稳定下来之后，对于杂乱的缓存设计也是时候理一理了。由于是资讯类的站点，我们的数据有着准实时性的特性，而缓存上我们希望是支持HTTP（这样将缓存前置，性能更高效），需要缓存设置与过期等都简单易用。在考察了各类的缓存软件，最终我们选择了<code>varnish</code>，使用<code>varnish</code>做HTTP缓存，缓存处理前置，避免更复杂的各缓存数据的交叉影响，在完成系统切换之后，感觉一下子世界变得美好多了，一切都是那么有条不紊。</p>\\n<p>在这几年使用<code>varnish</code>的过程中，也遇到过不少的坑，它的<code>vcl</code>很强大，可以通过自己配置各种不同的缓存处理方式，而用得越多，越来越觉得不需要太复杂的配置方式。</p>\\n<p>我们的现状是每个系统都自己配置一套自己的<code>vcl</code>，大家已迷失在配置的海洋里。后续开始慢慢收敛自定义的配置，只支持使用HTTP的<code>Cache-Control</code>来处理缓存，标准化此类中间件的使用。</p>\\n<p><code>varnish</code>很好很强大，一直以来都想自己来实现一个类似的<code>varnish</code>，但是以前只是对<code>node.js</code>比较熟悉，<code>C/C++</code>还处于很水货的层面（主要学不懂），后来接触了<code>golang</code>，其性能上的优越性让我心动不已，因此码出一个http

public, max-age=3600, s-maxage=60</code>。如果想了解<code>varnish</code>的各种特性，可以阅读我之前写的<code>善用HTTP缓存利器-Varnish</code></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"http缓存服务的设计\\\"><a

这种接口都是不可缓存的）</li>\\n<li>对于过期缓存数据能自动清除，不需要手工干预</li>\\n<li>支持健康检查，支持不同的策略选择后端服务</li>\\n<li>简化配置，配置文件使用<code>yaml</code>格式，简单易懂</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>下面看看pike的配置（最简化的）：</p>\\n<div

You will find the component definition responsible for the PropTypes direct call. Most likely, the issue is due to third-party PropTypes that wrap React’s PropTypes, for example:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"gatsby-code-jsx\\\"><code>Button<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>propTypes <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  highlighted<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> ThirdPartyPropTypes<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">deprecated</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n    PropTypes<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>bool<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'Use `active` prop instead'</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>In this case, <code>ThirdPartyPropTypes.deprecated</code> is a wrapper calling <code>PropTypes.bool</code>. This pattern by itself is fine, but triggers a false positive because React thinks you are calling PropTypes directly.

You should ensure that your DOM elements do not have spurious props floating around.</p>\\n<p>There are a couple of likely reasons this warning could be appearing:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>Are you using <code>{...this.props}</code> or <code>cloneElement(element, this.props)</code>? Your component is transferring its own props directly to a child element (eg. <a href=\\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/transferring-props.html\\\">https://reactjs.org/docs/transferring-props.html</a>). When transferring props to a child component, you should ensure that you are not accidentally forwarding props that were intended to be interpreted by the parent component.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>You are using a non-standard DOM attribute on a native DOM node, perhaps to represent custom data. If you are trying to attach custom data to a standard DOM element, consider using a custom data attribute as described <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes\\\">on MDN</a>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>React does not yet recognize the attribute you specified. This will likely be fixed in a future version of React. However, React currently strips all unknown attributes, so specifying them in your React app will not cause them to be rendered.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>You are using a React component without an upper case. React interprets it as a DOM tag because <a href=\\\"/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#user-defined-components-must-be-capitalized\\\">React JSX transform uses the upper vs. lower case convention to distinguish between user-defined components and DOM tags</a>.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<hr>\\n<p>To fix this, composite components should “consume” any prop that is intended for the composite component and not intended for the child component.
